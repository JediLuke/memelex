  A personal Memex, written in Elixir, inspired by TiddlyWiki.

  A memex is a device in which an individual stores all one's books,
  records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it
  may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is
  an enlarged intimate supplement to one's memory.
